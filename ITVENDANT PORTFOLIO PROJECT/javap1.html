        <p>

Hi, my name is S. Balaji and I am a B-tech graduate in Information Technology from Chennai. I am a dedicated and hardworking individual who enjoys learning new things and staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends. My passion for technology and problem-solving has led me to pursue a career in the IT industry.

During my studies, I gained a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python. I also have experience with web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe that these skills, combined with my eagerness to learn, will make me a valuable asset to any team.

In my free time, I enjoy reading books and staying active by playing sports like cricket and basketball. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends. Thank you for considering my self-introduction, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your organization.

          <li>
            <h3></h3>A Novel Method For Optical Disease Diagnosing 
Using Resnet 50 Algorithm
            <p>Fundus analysis studies the 
relationship between human health and 
changes in the anatomy of the iris. Apart 
from the fact that Fundus recognition 
focuses on modeling the overall structure 
of the iris, Fundus diagnosis emphasizes 
the detecting and analyzing of local 
variations in the characteristics of irises. 
This system presents a computerized 
iridology system for detecting 
abnormality conditions in the body. 
Which is designed with help of image 
processing through several stages such as 
pre-processing, feature extraction, 
classification using threshold Algorithm 
and blockchain. This system produces 
accuracy rate of 99.4% which is 
relatively higher than the existing non 
invasive models</p>
